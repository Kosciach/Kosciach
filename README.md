                BlueVRed is a top down shooter inspired by one of my first games I have made in javascript.
As name suggests, in this game you fight as a blue side against increasing ammount of red enemies.
                Your goal as player is to beat the highscore and get as big score as possible. Game provides 4 diffrent difficulties and each of them has their own highscore, which can be inspected or reset from mainmenu.
One of the biggest features are abilities which player has a chance to get upon killing and enemy, each ability has a drop chance which adds balance.
                Now BlueVRed is actually a second version with better abilities, effects, movement, ui, audio and more.
                <br> More in the games readme.

                Created for IcoJam 2023 - 3... 2.. 1.<br>
Main goal of the game is to recreate the generated shape.<br>
                Player has to analize and remember given shape in 3s, and then using given tools, recreate it is best as player can.<br>
                Shape settings are seperated into:<br>
                1| Base: Scale, FillColor, OutlineColor, OutlineSize<br>
                2| Specialized: each shape has its own special settings that no other shape uses.
